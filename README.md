# Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition
- This project aims to revolutionize the traditional manual attendance system by transitioning it to an online platform. The objective is to capture the facial features of each student and store them in a database for attendance tracking purposes. Through advanced facial recognition technology, the system can automatically detect and record the presence of students without the need for manual attendance taking by the teacher.

- The proposed system functions by capturing a video of the classroom and applying subsequent processing steps to identify and recognize the faces of the students. This data is then used to update the attendance database. Faculty members have the authority to take attendance, generate attendance reports, and compile a list of absentees. They can also search for the attendance records of specific students using a multiparameter search feature.

- New student users are provided with the option to register themselves in the system. They can update their personal details and view their attendance records. A superuser, who holds administrative privileges, is responsible for granting credentials to new users, whether they are students or teachers.

- For the development of the web application, the Django web framework was utilized. Additionally, OpenCV and the face_recognition API were employed to create the face recognition functionality. The Face Recognizer component is capable of detecting multiple faces simultaneously and accurately marking their attendance in the database.

- This project signifies a significant technological advancement in the realm of knowledge-oriented technical innovations. By automating the attendance process and leveraging facial recognition technology, it offers a streamlined and efficient solution for attendance management in educational institutions.
