# Attendance_System_using_Face_Recognition
# About
The technology aims in imparting a tremendous knowledge oriented technical innovations these days. We decided to take the entire manual attendance system online.The task of the proposed system is to capture the face of each student and to store it in the database for their attendance. The face of the student needs to be captured in such a manner that all the feature of the students' face needs to be detected. There is no need for the teacher to manually take attendance in the class because the system records a video and through further processing steps the face is being recognized and the attendance database is updated. 
The Faculty has the permission to take Attendance, generate attendance reports and generate defaulter's list. The Faculty can also search for attendance of a student using Multiparameter Search.A new student user has an option to register himself to the system, can update his details and view his attendance.
There is a superuser present who provides credentials to the new user i.e student or teacher.
Django web framework was used for the development of the whole web app. OpenCv and face_recognition API's were used for the development of Face Recognizer. The Face Recognizer can detect multiple faces at a time and mark their attendance into Database.
